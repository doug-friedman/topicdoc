Like a (good) doctor, the goal of topicdoc is to help diagnose issues
with your topic models through a variety of different diagnostics and
metrics. There are a lot of great R packages for fitting topic models,
but not a lot that help evaluate their fit. This package seeks to fill
that void with functions that easily allow you to run those
diagnostics/metrics efficiently on a variety of topic models.

## Installation

You can install the development version of topicdoc from
[Github](https://www.github.com/doug-friedman/topicdoc) with:

``` r
remotes::install.packages("doug-friedman/topicdoc")
```

## Example

This is a simply use case - using the example model from `LDA` in
`topicmodels`.

``` r
library(topicdoc)
library(topicmodels)

data("AssociatedPress", package = "topicmodels")
lda <- LDA(AssociatedPress[1:20,], control = list(alpha = 0.1), k = 2)

# See the top 10 terms associated with each of the two topics
terms(lda, 10)
#>       Topic 1      Topic 2   
#>  [1,] "police"     "percent" 
#>  [2,] "noriega"    "year"    
#>  [3,] "i"          "bush"    
#>  [4,] "official"   "i"       
#>  [5,] "peres"      "gas"     
#>  [6,] "panama"     "rose"    
#>  [7,] "magellan"   "million" 
#>  [8,] "mrs"        "campaign"
#>  [9,] "spacecraft" "oil"     
#> [10,] "ago"        "rate"

# Calculate all diagnostics for each topic in the topic model
topic_diagnostics(lda, AssociatedPress[1:20,])
#>   topic_num topic_size mean_token_length dist_from_corpus
#> 1         1   5338.844               5.7        0.4123790
#> 2         2   5134.156               4.5        0.4934347

# ...or calculate them invidually
topic_size(lda)
#> [1] 5338.844 5134.156
```
